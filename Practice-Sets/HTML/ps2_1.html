     <h1>Mhendi</h1>
     <h2>Origin</h2>
     <p>Earliest use of henna dye can be traced back to ancient Babylon and Egypt.[6] In 6th century Arabia, its use was well known and used in medicine, overlapping with certain pagan customs in the same historical and cultural context as Islam. In India, it was in use by the 4th century CE, which is evidenced by the cave arts of Deccan region.[6][better source needed]. However, it likely became prevalent around the 12th century CE, aided by the rise of Islam in the subcontinent.</p>
